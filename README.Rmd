The P-Technique with lavaan
======================================================

Earlier this year, I finally published an introduction to a dynamic p-technique, which is a statistical framework that allows one to analyze single-case and small group data within a multivariate statistical framework. You can find the official version of the paper [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212144718301807?via%3Dihub). It also lives in an [OSF project](https://osf.io/cbyj3/).

The purpose of this project is to prepare the series of blog posts on the p technique. The drafts will appear here, first. Then they'll make their way to my blog. Perhaps some time in the future, I'll string them together into a [bookdown book](https://bookdown.org).
